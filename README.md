This project is a web-based Anime Recommender System created using Streamlit, a Python library for building interactive web applications. The application allows users to select their favorite anime from a list and then provides personalized recommendations based on their choice. The recommendation data is loaded from a CSV file, and an anime dictionary is used to map the anime names. Users can simply choose an anime from the dropdown menu, click the "Recommend" button, and receive a list of recommended anime titles.

The application also enhances user experience by generating clickable links to Google search results for each recommended anime, making it easy for users to explore further information about their recommendations. The project aims to help anime enthusiasts discover new shows they might enjoy based on their existing preferences. Additionally, it demonstrates the integration of Streamlit with data manipulation techniques, allowing for a user-friendly interface for anime fans to find their next watch.
